/** Basic support for accounting properties.
 * 
 *  Accounting properties are the values that can live in records.
 *  They are referenced by name or by using the {@link uk.ac.ed.epcc.safe.accounting.properties.PropertyTag} object that provides a type-safe
 *  identifier. The names can either bare names or qualified with the registry where the tag is declared. 
 * 
 * This package handles support for named properties.
